	<h2>About Me</h2>
		<h3 style="text-align:center;">Background</h3>
			<p>I went from having a good, happy life to eventually turning to a life of drugs and sadness. </p>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;">Prison Life</h3>
			<p>Quickly after about a year of heavy drug using, I started to spiral even further and eventually ended up in prison, not once but twice.
			After getting out of prison the second time, I decided to start my life over and use my pain and past experiences to shape my future.</p>
		<h3 style="text-align: center;">Healthy Lifestyle/Art Projects</h3>
			<p>I eventually turned my life around to be focused on working out and creating art. Now I am looking to give back to those that are struggling
			like I was. I would like to share my story of hope and the idea that recovery is possible through determination and inner strength.</p>
